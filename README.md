# Integrated Al-Powered Talent Assessment System for Holistic Resume Analysis, Dynamic Interviewing, and Data-Driven Insights
**Project Overview**
This project introduces an advanced AI-powered talent assessment system designed to optimize recruitment processes.
It integrates sophisticated resume analysis with dynamic AI-driven interviewing, leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and the T5 Transformer Model.
The system extracts key skills, evaluates resumes, and generates personalized interview questions based on specific job requirements, enhancing hiring efficiency and fairness.

**Features**

- Semantic Resume Parsing: Extracts structured information from unstructured resumes using the T5 model.

- Dynamic Interview Generation: Creates role-specific and adaptive interview questions.

- Contextual Job-Candidate Fit: Evaluates skill-job alignment using contextual embeddings.

Bias Reduction and Feedback Learning: Continuously improves decision-making while minimizing biases.

Scalable Modular Architecture: Handles large applicant pools efficiently with flexibility and precision.

**Objectives**

Automate and optimize resume analysis and candidate evaluation.

Personalize interviews dynamically based on each candidate's background.

Provide recruiters with actionable, data-driven hiring insights.

Enhance candidate experience through personalized feedback.

Promote fair, unbiased recruitment practices.

**Problem Statement**

Traditional recruitment methods rely heavily on manual screening and subjective interviewing, leading to inefficiencies, inconsistencies, and biases.
Existing automated systems often struggle with unstructured data and lack personalization.
A smart, adaptive, and data-driven system is needed to:

Streamline the recruitment process.
